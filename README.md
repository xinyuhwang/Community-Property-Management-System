### Project Overview
This web application project, the Community Property Management System, is designed to streamline property management tasks through five key features: a dashboard for announcements and updates, a calendar schedule for booking and maintenance planning, a discussion board for resident interactions, a chat thread for trustee communication, and payment tools for secure fee transactions.

### Dataset
[iris.csv](https://github.com/ErdunE/CS5800-Final-Project/blob/main/iris.csv)

### Branching Strategy
* Main Branch: main
* Feature Branch Naming Convention: workspace-[workspace-name] (e.g., workspace-xinyu)
* All development should be done on workspace branches, and changes will only be merged into the team-project branch after review.
### Commit and Pull Request Guidelines
* Create a workspace branch for each member specific task.
* Push your changes to the workspace branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the team-project branch.
* Code Review: At least one team member must review and approve the PR before merging.
* Ensure tests pass before merging into the main project branch.
### Collaboration Workflow
1. Clone the Repository:
```

```
2. Create a Feature Branch:
```
git checkout -b workspace-xinyu
```
3. Commit and Push Your Changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m “Implemented Main.java”
git push origin workspace-xinyu
```
4. Create a Pull Request (PR):
    * Open a PR after pushing all new updates on your branch.
    * Request at least one other team member to review your PR.
5. Merge Changes:
    * Once the review is approved, and all tests pass, merge the PR.
